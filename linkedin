To automate posting to your LinkedIn account without using Selenium, you can use the LinkedIn API. The API offers various endpoints for different actions, including posting updates. Here are the step-by-step instructions to achieve this:

Step 1: Create a LinkedIn Developer Account

Go to the LinkedIn Developer Portal (https://www.linkedin.com/developers/) and sign in with your LinkedIn account.
Click on "My Apps" in the top right corner and then click "Create App".
Fill in the required information, including the name of your app, the logo, the description, and the website URL.
Agree to the terms of service and click "Create App".

Step 2: Set Up Authentication

On the app dashboard, go to the "Auth" tab and add the "OAuth 2.0 Redirect URLs" by clicking on "Add Redirect URL". This URL will be used for authentication purposes.
Under the "Auth" tab, find the "Client ID" and "Client Secret". These will be used to authenticate your API requests.

Step 3: Obtain an Access Token

To post updates on LinkedIn, you need to obtain an access token. The access token is used to authenticate your API requests.
You can use any HTTP client library in your preferred programming language to send a POST request to the LinkedIn API with the following parameters:
Grant Type: authorization_code
Code: The authorization code obtained by redirecting the user to the LinkedIn authorization URL
Redirect URI: The same redirect URL you added in the app dashboard
Client ID: Your app's client ID
Client Secret: Your app's client secret
The response will contain an access token, which you should store securely for future API requests.

Step 4: Make a POST Request to the Share API

To post a new update on LinkedIn, you can use the Share API endpoint.
Construct a JSON payload representing the update you want to post. The payload should include the update's content (text and/or media).
Use your preferred HTTP client library to send a POST request to the Share API endpoint:
URL: https://api.linkedin.com/v2/ugcPosts
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer [access token]
Content-Type: application/json
Body: The JSON payload representing the update
The response will contain the newly created update's details, including its ID.

Step 5: Error Handling and Rate Limiting

Handle possible errors and rate limiting by checking the response status codes and headers.
Refer to the LinkedIn API documentation for information on error codes, rate limiting, and how to handle them appropriately.

Note: The implementation details of authentication and HTTP requests may vary depending on the programming language you are using. Below is an example code snippet in Python using the requests library:

 
import requests

# Step 3: Obtain an Access Token
auth_code = "YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE"
redirect_uri = "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"

token_url = "https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/accessToken"
params = {
    "grant_type": "authorization_code",
    "code": auth_code,
    "redirect_uri": redirect_uri,
    "client_id": client_id,
    "client_secret": client_secret
}

response = requests.post(token_url, data=params)
access_token = response.json()["access_token"]

# Step 4: Make a POST Request to the Share API
share_api_url = "https://api.linkedin.com/v2/ugcPosts"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "author": "urn:li:person:123456789",
    "lifecycleState": "PUBLISHED",
    "specificContent": {
        "com.linkedin.ugc.ShareContent": {
            "shareCommentary": {
                "text": "Hello, LinkedIn!"
            },
            "shareMediaCategory": "NONE"
        }
    },
    "visibility": {
        "com.linkedin.ugc.MemberNetworkVisibility": "PUBLIC"
    }
}

response = requests.post(share_api_url, headers=headers, json=payload)
new_update_id = response.json()["id"]

print(f"Successfully posted a new update with ID: {new_update_id}")
 

This code assumes you have already obtained the authorization code as part of the authentication process.
Make sure to replace the placeholders (YOUR_AUTHORIZATION_CODE, YOUR_REDIRECT_URI, YOUR_CLIENT_ID, YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET, and urn:li:person:123456789) with your own values.

Keep in mind that the LinkedIn API may have additional rate limiting and usage restrictions, so be sure to check the LinkedIn API documentation for further details on endpoint specifications, request formats,
