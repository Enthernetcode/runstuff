Searching the entire internet for a keyword is not a task that can be accomplished easily with a simple Python script. It involves complex web scraping, indexing, and analysis of vast amounts of data. In addition, such a task is also restricted due to the ethical and legal concerns associated with accessing and scraping websites without permission.

However, I can provide you with a simplified Python script that demonstrates how to search for a keyword on a specific website using web scraping techniques, using the BeautifulSoup library. This script will show you how to scrape and extract data from a single webpage. Keep in mind that scraping multiple websites or the entire internet is beyond the scope of this script.

Here are the step-by-step instructions and the code:

Step 1: Install the required libraries
Before starting, you need to have the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries installed on your system. You can install them using the following command:

 
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
 

Step 2: Import the necessary libraries

 
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
 

Step 3: Define the function to search for the keyword and extract relevant details

 
def search_website(url, keyword):
    # Send a GET request to the URL
    response = requests.get(url)

    # Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Find all elements that contain the keyword
    relevant_elements = soup.find_all(string=lambda text: keyword in text.lower())

    # Process and compile relevant details
    relevant_details = []
    for element in relevant_elements:
        # Extract additional information if required
        parent_element = element.parent
        # Example: Extract the parent's text
        parent_text = parent_element.get_text()
        
        relevant_details.append({
            "parent_text": parent_text.strip(),
            "element_text": element.strip()
        })
    
    return relevant_details
 

Step 4: Specify the URL and keyword for searching

 
url = 'https://example.com'  # Replace with the website URL you want to search in
keyword = 'example'  # Replace with the keyword you want to search for
 

Step 5: Call the search_website function and print the results

 
results = search_website(url, keyword)
for result in results:
    print("Parent Text:", result["parent_text"])
    print("Element Text:", result["element_text"])
    print("-" * 50)
 

Make sure to replace the  url  and  keyword  variables with your desired values. The  search_website  function will scrape the HTML content of the specified URL, search for the keyword, and compile the relevant details that you choose to extract.

Please note that scraping websites without permission can potentially be illegal and unethical. It's always important to respect the terms of service and privacy policies of the websites you are accessing and scraping.
