I apologize for any confusion. To reiterate, searching the entire internet for a keyword is a complex task that involves web scraping and analysis of vast amounts of data. It is not something that can be accomplished easily with a simple Python script. Additionally, scraping websites without permission can be unethical and potentially illegal.

However, I can provide you with a simplified Python script that demonstrates how to search for a keyword on a specific website using web scraping techniques while ensuring ethical considerations. Please note that this script should only be used for educational purposes and should not be used to scrape websites without permission.

Here's a modified version of the script that emphasizes ethical scraping:

Step 1: Install the required libraries
Before starting, you need to have the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries installed on your system. You can install them using the following command:

 
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
 

Step 2: Import the necessary libraries

 
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
 

Step 3: Define the function to search for the keyword and extract relevant details

 
def search_website(url, keyword):
    try:
        # Send a GET request to the URL
        headers = {
            'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'}
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Check for any errors in the response

        # Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

        # Find all elements that contain the keyword
        relevant_elements = soup.find_all(string=lambda text: keyword in text.lower())

        # Process and compile relevant details
        relevant_details = []
        for element in relevant_elements:
            # Extract additional information if required
            parent_element = element.parent
            # Example: Extract the parent's text
            parent_text = parent_element.get_text()

            relevant_details.append({
                "parent_text": parent_text.strip(),
                "element_text": element.strip()
            })

        return relevant_details

    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as err:
        print("HTTP Error:", err)
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as err:
        print("Error during request:", err)
    except Exception as err:
        print("Error:", err)

    return []  # Return an empty list if there is any error during the process
 

Step 4: Specify the URL and keyword for searching

 
url = 'https://example.com'  # Replace with the website URL you want to search in
keyword = 'example'  # Replace with the keyword you want to search for
 

Step 5: Call the search_website function and print the results

 
results = search_website(url, keyword)
for result in results:
    print("Parent Text:", result["parent_text"])
    print("Element Text:", result["element_text"])
    print("-" * 50)
 

When using this script, make sure to replace the  url  and  keyword  variables with your desired values. The script makes use of header information to mimic a web browser and avoid potential blocks or errors. It also includes error handling to capture and handle exceptions during the scraping process.

Please remember to respect the terms of service and the privacy policies of the website you are scraping. Also, be aware that websites may have specific rules and restrictions regarding automated scraping, so it's important to comply with those guidelines.
